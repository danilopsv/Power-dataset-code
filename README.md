This algorithm consists of a power simulator for photovoltaic panels and  a wind turbine. This simulator was developed using mathematical models based on the research article “Management of an island and grid-connected microgrid using hybrid economic model predictive control  with weather data”, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115581
